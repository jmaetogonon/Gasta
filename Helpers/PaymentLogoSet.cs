/// Bundled payment-method logo assets under wwwroot/images/payments/.
///
/// Two separate sets, because a payment method can have two different logo shapes:
/// - Logos: wide rectangular wordmarks (brand name baked into the artwork), always
///   .svg, filename has no extension here — matches the original convention.
/// - IconLogos: square/circular mark-only variants, for contexts where a rectangle
///   doesn't fit (circular badges).
///
/// A method only needs an entry in IconLogos if a square asset actually exists for
/// it — anything missing here just falls back to the wordmark (see PaymentMethodIcon's
/// PreferIcon logic), so this list can be filled in gradually, one brand at a time.
